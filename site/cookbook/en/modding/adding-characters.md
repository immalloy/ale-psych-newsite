# Adding Characters

Characters are defined by sprite assets plus a data file that describes animations, offsets, and metadata.

## Character assets

- Store character sprites in your mod's `characters/` or `images/` folder (match your engine conventions).
- Use consistent naming for idle, sing, and special animations.

## Character data

Create a character JSON definition that points to the sprite sheet, animation names, and offsets. Keep values consistent with existing character files so the editor can read them.

## Test the character

- Use the Character Editor (`8` in developer mode) to load and inspect your new character.
- Verify idle loops, sing animations, and offsets in gameplay.

## TODO

TODO: This page is unfinished - complete this section.
