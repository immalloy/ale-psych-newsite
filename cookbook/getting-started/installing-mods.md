# Installing Mods

Mods are installed by dropping them into the `mods/` folder and enabling them from the Mods menu in-game.

## Find the mods folder

- The engine looks for a `mods/` directory next to the game executable.
- If it does not exist, create it manually and restart the game.

## Install a mod package

1. Extract the mod zip or folder into `mods/`.
2. Confirm the mod folder contains files like `data.json`, `pack.json`, or asset subfolders such as `images/` and `songs/`.
3. Avoid nested folders (for example `mods/MyMod/MyMod/`).

## Enable the mod

- Open the Mods menu with `Ctrl + Shift + M`.
- Toggle the mod on and restart if prompted.
