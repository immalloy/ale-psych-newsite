# ALE Psych Engine Overview

![ALE Psych logo](https://github.com/ALE-Psych-Crew/ALE-Psych/raw/main/art/githubLogo.png)

ALE Psych Engine is a fork of Psych Engine 0.7.3 focused on letting modders build full-featured mods without touching engine source code. It ships with expanded scripting, configurable game flow, and mod-first data overrides.

## What makes ALE Psych different

- Scriptable menus, substates, and gameplay using Lua or HScript.
- Custom classes and RuleScript support for reusable HScript modules.
- Mod-level configuration through `data.json`, `options.json`, and `debug.json`.
- Scripted content living alongside chart, audio, and assets per song.
- Quality-of-life tools like a built-in debug console and improved mod sandboxing.

## Who this cookbook is for

- New modders installing the engine for the first time.
- Existing Psych Engine users migrating content to ALE Psych.
- Scripters building custom states, events, and menu flows.
