**ALE Psych** is a fork of **Psych Engine 0.7.3**, created to replace **ALE Engine**, fix long-standing issues, and add new features.

The goal is simple: give developers the tools to build complete mods **without touching the source code**, while keeping the comfort and flexibility that Psych Engine provided.
