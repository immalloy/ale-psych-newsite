# Adding Weeks

Weeks group multiple songs into a story or progression set. They define the order, characters, and presentation for Story Mode.

## Week definitions

- Each week entry lists the songs in order.
- Include metadata such as week name, character previews, and background.

## Week ordering

- Ensure the week order matches the progression you want in Story Mode.
- Use consistent naming so the Freeplay list aligns with Story Mode.

## Test the week

- Enter Story Mode and confirm the song sequence.
- Check that week art and character previews load correctly.

## TODO

TODO: This page is unfinished - complete this section.
