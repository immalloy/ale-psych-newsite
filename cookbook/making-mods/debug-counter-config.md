 debug.json

The engine initializes its debug overlay on boot. It always shows built-in FPS, Conductor info, and Flixel stats, then appends any panels defined in debug.json .
Load Order

Place a custom file at mods/<your-mod>/debug.json to override the fallback at assets/debug.json . To disable all custom panels but keep defaults, set an empty fields array.
File Structure

debug.json contains a top-level object with a fields array. Each entry is a panel represented as an array of label objects stacked vertically.

Label objects support:

    lines (required): Array of snippets joined to form the label text; each snippet declares a type .
    size (optional, Int, default 15 ): Font size.
    color (optional, string or int): CSS-style string (e.g. "#FF0000" ) or ARGB integer.
    offset (optional, Float): Extra vertical spacing above and below the label.

Supported Line Types
text

    Inserts a static string.
    Requires value .

{ "type": "text", "value": "Health: " }
    

JSON
variable

    Resolves a value from a static class every frame.
    Requires path (full class name) and variable (public static or instance field; dot paths allowed).
    If the class or variable does not exist, the unresolved string is printed for debugging instead of crashing.

{ "type": "variable", "path": "funkin.states.PlayState", "variable": "instance.health" }

Runtime Behavior

    Debug labels update every frame and the stack resizes to the longest label width.
    Toggle the overlay with the key bound to "FPS Counter" (default F3 ): first press FPS-only, second press full panel view, third press hidden.

Example debug.json

Create a custom panel titled "Gameplay" with dynamic labels for health and song name:

{
        "fields": [
        [
        {
        "lines": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Gameplay" }
        ],
        "size": 18,
        "color": "#80FF80"
        },
        {
        "lines": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Health: " },
        { "type": "variable", "path": "funkin.states.PlayState", "variable": "instance.health" }
        ]
        },
        {
        "lines": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Song: " },
        { "type": "variable", "path": "funkin.states.PlayState", "variable": "SONG.song" }
        ],
        "offset": 6
        }
        ]
        ]
        }

Notes

    Add as many panels as needed; each is an array inside fields .
    The variable type can read any globally accessible Haxe class, including utilities you provide.
    Real-time updates make this useful for monitoring gameplay data such as health, difficulty, or note accuracy.
