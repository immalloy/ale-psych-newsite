# Scripted Cutscenes

Scripted cutscenes let you control animations, camera moves, dialogue, and timed events before or after songs.

## Cutscene flow

- Define a cutscene script that runs before the song starts or after it ends.
- Use timers or event callbacks to sequence animations, dialogue, and transitions.

## Asset preparation

- Preload backgrounds, dialogue portraits, and audio to avoid stutter.
- Keep file names consistent with your script references.

## Playback testing

- Test in Story Mode and Freeplay to confirm the cutscene triggers.
- Use developer mode logs to confirm timing.

## TODO

TODO: This page is unfinished - complete this section.
